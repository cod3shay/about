    <h3>Where it started</h3>
     <p>Life originated for me in the 757, otherwise known as the seven cities. I was raised in Hampton, Virginia, the place I still call home, but now reside in the NoVA area.</p>

    <h3>How it's going</h3>
    <p>Ya know, life has been a rollercoaster ride, but I'm finally learning how to take the wheel and skrt skrt! As a kid, I imagined myself becoming a chef one day and spreading love through food. I <em>definitely</em> still love food, but life is taking me in different directions these days. Plus, I'm too picky of an eater anyway!</p>

    <p>As of lately, I'm interested in things like HTML and CSS; don't worry, JavaScript, I'll make room for you when the time comes.</p>

  <h3>Facts</h3>
    <p>Outside of coding, I'm into other things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>FOOD</li>
            <li>Scheming on my future!</li>
        </ol>
    <p>You'll rarely catch me without:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My phone <em>[duh]</em></li>
            <li>A scrunchy on my wrist</li>
        </ul>
